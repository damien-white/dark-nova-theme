# Dark Nova

Dark Nova is a colorful theme with semantic token / highlighting support.

## Language Support

This theme supports a limited subset of languages at this time:
- Rust
  - Schema definiton languages, such as JSON, TOML, etc.

### Warning

Using this theme with any other language, at this time, will be a total gamble and I would advise
against it.

## Stability

**Unstable** / **pre-alpha** software.

Despite the theme being in its infancy, I am already using it as my "daily driver". Thus, you can be
sure that updates will be frequent and anything broken will promptly be fixed!

## Development Status

This project is under active development and will receive frequent updates until it reaches a point
of stability that I am comfortable with. Please use at your own risk, as there **will be** many
**breaking changes** as I iron out the issues and get the palette's colors to play well with each other.

### Miscellaneous

I am simply a developer and, although I try my best, I am not a designer. If you experience issues
regarding colors clashing in ways that you disapprove of, or if something is not working right, please
open an issue on GitHub.
